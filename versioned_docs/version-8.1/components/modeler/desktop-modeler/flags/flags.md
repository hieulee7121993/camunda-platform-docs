Flags allow you to control the availability of certain features within Desktop Modeler.

## Configuring Flags

You may configure flags in a `flags.json` file or pass them via CLI.

### Configure in `flags.json`

Place a `flags.json` file inside the `resources` folder of your local [`{USER_DATA}`](../search-paths#user-data-directory) or [`{APP_DATA_DIRECTORY}`](../search-paths#app-data-directory) directory to persist them.

### Configure via CLI

Pass flags via the command line when starting the application.

```
camunda-modeler --disable-plugins
```

Flags passed as command line arguments take precedence over those configured via a configuration file.

## Available Flags

## Examples

### BPMN-only Mode

To disable the CMMN and DMN editing capabilities of the App, configure your `flags.json` like this:

```js
{
    "disable-dmn": true,
    "disable-form": true
}
```

As a result, the app will only allow users to model BPMN diagrams.

### Custom `display-version` label

To display a custom version information in the status bar of the app, configure your `flags.json` like this:

```js
{
    "display-version": "1.2.3"
}
```

### Zeebe SSL certificate

> :information_source: The Modeler will read trusted certificates from your operating system's trust store.

Provide additional certificates to validate secured connections to a Camunda Platform 8 installation. 

Configure your `flags.json` like this:

```js
{
    "zeebe-ssl-certificate": "C:\\path\\to\\certs\\trusted-custom-roots.pem"
}
```

Additional information adapted from the [upstream documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions):

> The peer (Camunda Platform 8) certificate must be chainable to a CA trusted by the app for the connection to be authenticated. When using certificates that are not chainable to a well-known CA, the certificate's CA must be explicitly specified as trusted or the connection will fail to authenticate. If the peer uses a certificate that doesn't match or chain to one of the default CAs, provide a CA certificate that the peer's certificate can match or chain to. For self-signed certificates, the certificate is its own CA, and must be provided.
