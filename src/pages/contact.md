# Contact

There are various channels where you can reach us.

- We encourage everyone to participate in our **community** via the [Camunda Platform community forum](https://forum.camunda.io/) or [Slack](https://camunda-cloud.slack.com/), where you can exchange ideas with other Zeebe and Camunda Platform 8 users, as well as the product developers. If you are joining our Slack for the first time, you will need to get an [invite](https://camunda.com/slack) first.

- We welcome your **bug** reports and **feature requests** through our community channels mentioned above.

- For **security-related issues**, review our [Security notices](../../docs/reference/notices) for the most up-to-date information on known issues and steps to report a vulnerability so we can solve the problem as quickly as possible. Do not use GitHub for security-related issues.

- **Feedback and Support** can be submitted or requested via JIRA for subscription or enterprise customers in the Support project. Otherwise, use the [Camunda Platform community forum](https://forum.camunda.io/).
